# Italian Orthographic to IPA Conversion Algorithm

## Overview
This document outlines an algorithm designed to convert Italian orthographic text into its International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) representation. The goal is to facilitate linguistic research, speech therapy, and language learning by providing a systematic approach to transcribe Italian words into their phonetic forms.

## Algorithm Description
The algorithm employs a set of rules that map Italian orthographic representations to their corresponding IPA symbols. It takes into account the nuances of Italian phonology, including vowel length, consonant gemination, and the effects of stress on pronunciation.

### Input
- A string of Italian text.

### Output
- A string of text transcribed in IPA symbols.

## Process
1. **Preprocessing:** Normalize the input text (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation).
2. **Vowel Conversion:** Apply rules for vowel sounds, considering aspects such as open vs. closed vowels.
3. **Consonant Conversion:** Transform consonants based on their phonetic context (e.g., 'c' before 'i' or 'e').
4. **Special Cases Handling:** Address specific cases like 'gli', 'gn', and silent letters.
5. **Stress Determination:** Mark stressed vowels according to Italian pronunciation rules.
6. **IPA Transcription:** Compile the IPA symbols into a coherent output string.

## Considerations
- The algorithm assumes standard Italian pronunciation.
- Regional variations and exceptions may require additional rules or adjustments.

## Example
Given the Italian word "ciao", the algorithm will output "/ˈtʃao/".

## Conclusion
This algorithm provides a foundational tool for converting Italian orthographic text to IPA, aiding various applications in linguistics and clinical therapy.
